# imageColorQuantization
Using K-means algorithm for color clustering and optimization. 

Color quanitization is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image. This enables extremely efficient storage and compression of images.
